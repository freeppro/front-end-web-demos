JavaScript Closures
===================

JavaScript closures are fundamental to Front End Development.

`function-expression.js`
------------------------

Shows the similarity between function expressions and function declarations. They're basically the same thing.

`function-closures.js`
----------------------

Takes you from function expressions to understanding how functions bind to scope (lexical closures).

`function-iteration.js`
-----------------------

An example of using closures to do something useful. Instead of using loop syntax we use a closure and an array's `forEach()` method.

You can run the examples in Firefox by following the next steps:

 1. Open Firefox
 2. Open ScratchPad (Tools-> Web Developer -> Scratchpad or Shift + F4)
